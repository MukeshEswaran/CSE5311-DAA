### **1. Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Example Source**: The structure of the graph matches the example on **Page 659** (Section 24.3 in the book). This is a straightforward graph that demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm's behavior in finding shortest paths with non-negative edge weights.
---

### **2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
- **Example Source**: Similar in structure to the example in **Figure 24.4 (Page 653)**. This graph is designed to show how Bellman-Ford handles negative edge weights and detects shortest paths while avoiding issues with negative cycles.
---

### **3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
- **Example Source**: The structure is inspired by **Section 25.2 (Page 684)**, specifically the discussion of the algorithm's operation on a graph with multiple vertices and edges of varying weights.
